# Reflection on Using Microsoft Copilot for InventoryHub

Throughout this project, Microsoft Copilot was an absolute game-changer for full-stack development. Here’s a quick rundown:

- **Integration Code:** Copilot quickly generated the API consumption logic in Blazor, handling HTTP calls and JSON deserialization.
- **Debugging:** It suggested fixes for CORS errors and corrected API routes, making troubleshooting way faster.
- **JSON Structure:** Copilot helped me design nested JSON responses that are clean and industry-standard compliant.
- **Optimization:** It recommended caching strategies and code refactoring tips, improving performance and maintainability.

Challenges like malformed JSON and synchronization issues were eased by Copilot’s context-aware suggestions, which sped up development and reduced bugs. Learning to prompt Copilot effectively was key to unlocking these benefits.

Overall, Copilot transformed a complex full-stack workflow into a smooth, efficient experience.
